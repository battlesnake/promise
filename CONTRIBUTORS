If you submit contributions to this project and do not transfer the copyright
to Open Cosmos Ltd, then you must license your contributions to Open Cosmos
Ltd. under the Expat (MIT) license.

I (Mark Cowan) intend to change the project license from GPL2 to MIT once the
project is more mature and has an active community around it.

I use GPL2 for the project's embryonic stage because I want people to
contribute work back to it, and I'll switch to MIT when it's active and mature
enough because I also want people to actually use it for cool stuff.

The reason I require contributions to be provided under the MIT license rather
than GPL2 is so that I can re-license to MIT in future without having to
individually get permission from every contributor.
